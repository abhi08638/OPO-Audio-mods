Main Mic Switch
==============

If the Main Microphone is broken on the OnePlus One, then the stock mixer_paths.xml file will not allow you to have audio input even if there are other internal microphones available. 

This mod ONLY bypasses the main mic in favor of the secondary mic and enables full audio input.
